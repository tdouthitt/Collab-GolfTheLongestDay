            The Longest Day is a team event to raise funds and awareness for the Alzheimer's Association (the r symbol). Held annually on the summer solstice, the duration of this sunrise-to-sunset event symbolizes the challenging journey of those living with the disease and their caregivers.

          </h5>
          <p>
            Would you like to test your endurance? Play in a 2 person team from daylight to dark! Do you have a 100 holes in your bag? 110? This is the day to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            Would you rather support a great cause but not limp home? Bring in more friends and "tag team" your way through the daylight hours. For pace of play we ask that only 2 members o fyour team play at one time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A $200 registration fee per team reserves your spot on the course, and not just nay course... The Dakota Dunes Country Club, designed by gold legend, Arnold Palmer. Golfers will be provided a cart, breakfast, lunch, dinne and a sunset after-party on the Terrace!
          </p>
          <p>
            We ask that each team set a minimum goal to raise $1000 for the Alzheimer's Association.
